# SRC-0001: Standardization Protocol for Computing Providers on Swanchain

## Simple Summary
This proposal introduces a standardized protocol for Computing Providers (CPs) on Swanchain, including `Account` registration and change events.

## Abstract



## Change Motivation




### Parties
 - MP

### Contracts

Now, there are two contracts for Computing Providers, `CPAccount` and `ContractRegistry`.

- CPAccount

[CPAccount](https://github.com/Normalnoise/ether-test/blob/v2/ubi/CPAccount.sol) is a account containing base information for Computing Providers, like `owner`, `worker`, `node_id` etc. A Computing Provider must start a new account contract before doing task.

```solidity
contract CPAccount {
    // contractRegistryAddress is the registry contract address of the account
    address public contractRegistryAddress;
    // owner is the owner address of the account
    address public owner;
    // worker is the worker address of the account
    address public worker;
    // nodeId is the node id of the account
    string public nodeId;
    // multiAddresses is the multiAddress list of the account
    string[] public multiAddresses;
    // beneficiary is the address to receive beneficiaries
    address public beneficiary;
    // taskTypes is the task type list to receive
    uint8[] public taskTypes;
    ...
}
```

- Contract Registry

[ContractRegistry](https://github.com/Normalnoise/ether-test/blob/v2/ubi/ContractRegistry.sol) is a contract pool to collect new account contract started by the Computing Providers, and listens change events from the colleted contracts.

```solidity
contract ContractRegistry {
    ...
    event CPContractRegistered(address indexed cpContract, address indexed owner);
    event CPAddressChanged(address indexed cp, address newCP);

    function registerCPContract(address cpContract, address owner) external {}

    function changeOwner(address cpContract, address newOwner) external {}
}
```



## **Backwards Compatibility**

This FIP does not change actors behavior so it does not require any Filecoin network update.

## **Security Considerations**

This FIP does not touch underlying proofs or security.

## **Incentive Considerations**

No change to incentives. In the future this could support retrieval incentive.

## **Product Considerations**

No change to product considerations, except that increased content discoverability and retrieval capability is a net improvement to the Filecoin network.

In the near future, the product should include controls on what contents can be retrieved, so Storage Providers would have the ability to turn off content that they don’t want to be accessible for retrieval.

## **Implementation**
